 *  Factory pattern is one of the most used design patterns in Java. This type of design pattern comes under creational
 * pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.
 *  In Factory pattern, we create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created
 * object using a common interface.
